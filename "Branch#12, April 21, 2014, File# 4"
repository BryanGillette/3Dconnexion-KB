I am continuing with my quest of adding files to a branch.

Today I am working within Branch# 12.

I have added two other branches already this morning.

One branch to the master and another branch to some other sub branch.

I am backing up now and adding files to an old branch.

In this case, Branch# 12.

I tried opening some older branches, like Branch# 5, but it could not be found.

I can only conclude that I must have deleted some branches previously.

I suppose I could also delete some files.

maybe even from the master branch.

I can see where you might end up with a lot of versionings.

Well I think I will name this file:

"Branch#12, April 21, 2014, File# 4"
