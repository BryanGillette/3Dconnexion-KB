Magento Mobile?

How It Works
Enable the Mobile Tab in your Admin Panel.
Download the free extension from Magento Connect.
* Enterprise and Professional Editions 1.10 and higher and Community Edition 1.5 and higher already have this built in.

Purchase an application key (license) and submit your app to Magento using the Admin Panel in your Magento installation.
Enroll into the iOS Developer Program: http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/

(if you do not yet have an account).
Provide Magento with your iOS account username and password by emailing us at mobileinfo@magento.com with a subject line of "iOS Developer Account".
Magento completes the submission process to the respective marketplaces and maintains code for a low annual fee.
