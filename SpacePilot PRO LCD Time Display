Is there any way to adjust the way the LCD shows time on the SPP? 
My Outlook calendar items show in 24-hour and 
i'd like them to show in 12-hour AM/PM mode.smitty97

Hello smitty97 -

The SpacePilot PRO displays the format Outlook is sending and 
Outlook gets its time format from the country/region settings on your PC. 

Whether 12 or 24 hour format is the default depends on the country. 
For the US, Outlook displays a 12-hour clock. 
Other countries/regions use a 24-hour clock.

You can change the default used by the 
PC in Regional Options in the Windows Control Panel.

Hello smitty97 -

Unfortunately there is not an option in the SpacePilot PRO applets to change the display on the LCD.

I wonder if any of the hacks that have been done with the Logitech gaming keyboards with LCDs would work with the SpacePilot Pro. 
I just bought mine and am awaiting delivery and since I dont use Outlook 
Im hoping there is more that can be done. 
Otherwise that screen will end up being a waste for me.ben_r_

The SpacePilot Pro LCD is exactly the same LCD as used in the G19. 
You can run any Logitech applet on it.jwick

I have never played with a G19, where does one get applets for it that will work with the SpacePilot Pro LCD?ben_r_

LOL if youre gonna go that route, it's FAR more humorous when using this method: 

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=g19+applets

But seriously, I was kinda hoping someone around here had compiled a list of applets that are cool/helpful/common/popular. 
With as much as we pay for this unit it ought to have COME with them all available to install via the installation software.ben_r_

That is much cooler! I'm going to have to bookmark that tool.

The LCD doesn't seem to get much attention. I had much bigger hopes for it--it can even do full motion video! 
I expected an online Logitech community actively doing some inventive things. 
It's an underutilized resource, IMO.

I ported some of our demos to display on the LCD. 
It was like a hand-held game system

Yea I mean its totally awesome and could be soo useful! I LOVE how it displays the function keys as I cant remember from one app to the next. Although at the moment I cant get it to even show the Function Keys in the menu list thought it will bring up the Solidworks screen when Im in Solidworks. Going to try and reinstall the drivers again and see whats up. But yea, the screen is def a plus and should be more utilized by all who own this bad boy.ben_r_

You have to be careful with Solidworks. You have to make button assignments inside Solidworks so our plugin will save them. The plugin will take care of telling the driver what needs to be put on the LCD. Don't make changes in the 3DxWare GUI. 

Also, make sure you have your Solidworks profile selected in 3DxWare, or the Solidworks plugin could be trying to send these strings to the wrong profile. Clearing out your saved profiles is a good reset to any foul mismatches that may have happened.
