New File Being Added to Branch 10, 2015 12 14
I'm now editing this file to see what happends to the commit changes description.
There is a default listing:
Update [File Name].
when I created this file, I changed it to Yes.
I want to see what happends now, when I don't make an entery and just update this file with new editing.
