The 3Dconnexion plug-in in Maya depends on the command 'MagellanStartup' being executed by the 'usersetup.mel' file.

If the 3DxMaya plug-in is installed, but you are not seeing navigation in Maya, type "MagellanStartup" (without the quotes) at the Maya command line.
This will either enable navigation or generate an error that will let us know what the problem is.
("MagellanStartup" is case-sensitive.)

If navigation starts when you type "MagellanStartup" at the command prompt, but is not auto-starting, 
that would indicate that another instance of usersetup.mel is being used. 
When another script is installed it can overwrite the 3Dconnexion usersetup.mel.
To have the 3DxMaya plug-in auto-start you will need to add the MagellanStartup; line to the end of the active 'usersetup.mel' 

You can locate any other copies of 'usersetup.mel' by using Finder. 
If you have other scripts or add-ins such as Maya's Bonus Tools or GoZ, they add their own 'usersetup.mel' files. 
Open the 'usersetup.mel' file  in maya|scripts|startup and add the line 
 MagellanStartup;
at the end.

Maya only checks for the scripts on startup, so you can restart Maya or type "rehash;" 

If typing “MagellanStartup” (without quotes) at the Maya command line returns an error, 
check that you are using the current 3DxMacware software and if not , download it from from our web site under 
Service Menu, Download Driver Page. 
[http://www.3dconnexion.com/support/downloads.php].

If you are already using the current version, close Maya and run the 3Dconnexion .dmg again to install the plugin. 
Open Maya and go to Window->Settings|Preferences->Plug-In Manager to check that 3DxMaya.bundle is loaded 

If you are still seeing a problem please let us know whether MagellanStartup enables navigation and which other scripts or add-ins are in use.

--------------------------------

ALSO

Open Maya and go to Window->Settings|Preferences->Plug-In Manager to check that 3DxMaya.bundle is loaded 
If you are still not able to load the plugin , in Maya go to Window->Settings/Preferences->Plug-In Manager 
and check that 3DxMaya.bundle is loaded.
If it is not, check that the files are in the correct folders: 

Confirm the plug-in 3DxMaya.bundle is in 
Users-->Shared-->Autodesk-->maya-->2011-->plug-ins 

Confirm these files are in 
Users-->Shared-->Autodesk-->maya-->scripts C3DxButtonEditor.mel 

--

If typing “MagellanStartup” [without quotes] at the Maya command line returns an error: "3DxMaya.bundle" was not found on MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH , 
it indicates the plug-in is either not installed or not installed in the correct folders.
