What ever happen here.
They came in one day and said you have a meeting this Thursday after they meet with the other two agents.
When it finally came my time for the meeting, they explaine that my position in this program would be ending because one of the two corporations we supported were not going to renew their contract with us.
So I got busy, made a resume, re-applied, interviewed and got re-hired into L.A. Confidential.
