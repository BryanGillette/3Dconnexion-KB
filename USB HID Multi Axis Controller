Re: Is SpaceNavigator Really a HID device on Mac OS ?

Hi DC,

what you request for our devices has nothing to do with the driver. Its the device.

As already said, all of our devices are defined as USB HID Multi Axis Controller.
You mention the G27 Racing Wheel (I'm not familiar with it). This device may be defined as HID Joystick Device or even a HID Automobile Simulation Device.

Again, the easiest way to get a good support of our devices in Unity, also without the need of a plugin, will be to ask their developers to add support for HID Multi Axis Controller in Unity as well.

We are very keen on getting our devices supported (actually we're already in contact with the Unity developer), but we've made the experience, that customers have a bit more impact on companies regarding these issues. So please keep asking the Unity-Team for support! 

If you need assistance or have additional questions, please let us know - we're very happy to provide you with the needed information.


Regards,

Christian
